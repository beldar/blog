## Hello World!

I've lost the count on how many blogs I started and abandoned, and I always tell myself,
"this is going to be the one, I'm gonna crush it with this one", and the farthest I get is 10 posts or less.
This is because I normaly enjoy more setting up, designing, customizing the blog than actually writing on it.

But hey, **this one is going to be different**, I'm gonna crush it with this one!

I will honestly try to put in here the things I learn and use in a daily basis, new technologies, techniques and
stuff that obsesses me for a briefly amount of time.

This blog is being served from Github using Jekyll and Octopress.
